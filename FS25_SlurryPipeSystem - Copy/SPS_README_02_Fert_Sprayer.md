# Slurry Pipe System (SPS) — Adding a Fertiliser / Herbicide Sprayer

This guide is for vehicle modders who want their own sprayer (trailed or self-propelled)
to load liquid fertiliser / herbicide through the SPS pipe-and-coupler system, the way the
Kverneland iXtrack does.

**You never edit the SPS mod.** Everything is done inside *your own* vehicle's XML and i3d.
Editing files inside the SPS mod folder will break multiplayer and is not supported. SPS
reads your vehicle and configures itself automatically.

The sprayer system is **separate** from the slurry tanker system and uses its own
`<sprayerPipeSystem>` block. Do not mix the two blocks up — a sprayer uses
`<sprayerPipeSystem>`, a slurry tanker uses `<slurryPipeSystem>`. A vehicle *may* carry both
if it genuinely does both jobs, but most sprayers only need the sprayer block.

All element/attribute names below are exactly what the SPS parser reads. Misspell one and it
is silently ignored — that part of your vehicle just will not register.

---

## 1. How sprayers differ from slurry tankers

Read this first — the sprayer model is deliberately simpler than the slurry one:

- **No pressure model.** There is no `<pressure>`, no ±bar gauge, no vacuum/HVP/conduit
  pump types. Flow is a flat litres-per-second.
- **No hydraulic/manual valve type.** Sprayer couplings have no `valveType` attribute.
- **Pump and valve are one control.** Opening the valve turns the pump on; closing it turns
  the pump off. There is no separate "pump on" step.
- **One interaction point.** All connect / disconnect / valve / direction actions happen at
  a single walk-up **pump control node**. There are no per-coupler arc activatables, and the
  placeable/source side has no activatable of its own — everything is driven from the
  sprayer vehicle's pump control node.
- **Direction can only change while the valve is closed** (Load ↔ Unload).

---

## 2. How to register your sprayer — embedded block

Put a `<sprayerPipeSystem>` block directly inside your vehicle's own XML, as a child of the
root `<vehicle>` element:

```xml
<vehicle ...>
    ...
    <sprayerPipeSystem>
        ... SPS sprayer config ...
    </sprayerPipeSystem>
</vehicle>
```

When SPS sees `vehicle.sprayerPipeSystem` in your XML it treats the vehicle as
self-contained and uses it directly. Nothing is copied, nothing in the SPS folder changes.
On a successful load you will see in the log:

```
[SPS SPR] registerSprayerVehicle: registered <yourVehicle>.xml
```

---

## 3. Where the SPS nodes come from

Every `...NodeName` / `nodeName` attribute below is resolved by name. SPS looks in two
places, in order:

1. Nodes injected from an SPS **nodeTree** i3d (see below).
2. Failing that, a recursive search of your vehicle's own node tree (`rootNode`).

So you can either author the SPS nodes directly in your own i3d and just reference them by
name (simplest for your own vehicle), or ship them in a separate nodeTree i3d and inject
them.

### nodeTree (optional)

```xml
<nodeTree filename="path/to/nodes.i3d"/>
```

Path is relative to your vehicle's config folder. Injection rule: the nodeTree's first child
is the SPS root; under it are *group* transforms; under each group are *container*
transforms. **Each container's name must match a node name that already exists in your live
vehicle.** Every child of that container is unlinked from the nodeTree and re-linked under
the matching live node.

---

## 4. Flow rate — `<flow>`

```xml
<flow litersPerSecond="200"/>
```

| Attribute         | Default | Meaning |
|-------------------|---------|---------|
| `litersPerSecond` | 200     | Transfer rate in both directions. |

There is no separate fill/empty split on sprayers — one rate is used for Load and Unload.

---

## 5. Pipe couplings — `<sprayerPipeCouplings>`

The coupler the pipe connects to. At least one is required for anything to happen.

```xml
<sprayerPipeCouplings>
    <sprayerPipeCoupling id="1"
                         mountNodeName="couplerMount01"
                         flowDirection="BOTH"
                         maxPipeLength="7.5"
                         fillUnitIndex="1"
                         connectorAnimation="1"
                         valveAnimation="2"/>
</sprayerPipeCouplings>
```

| Attribute            | Default | Meaning |
|----------------------|---------|---------|
| `id`                 | index+1 | Identifier. |
| `mountNodeName`      | —       | The coupler mount node. **Required** — coupling skipped if not found. |
| `flowDirection`      | `BOTH`  | `BOTH`, `FILL`, or `DISCHARGE`. |
| `maxPipeLength`      | 7.5     | Max metres a pipe may span from this coupler. |
| `fillUnitIndex`      | 1       | Fill unit filled/emptied by this coupler. |
| `connectorAnimation` | —       | Optional coupler-clamp animation id (see §7). |
| `valveAnimation`     | —       | Optional valve animation id (see §7). |

**Required child nodes:** the mount node must contain two transforms named exactly `inNode`
and `outNode` somewhere in its hierarchy. SPS finds them automatically. The pipe visual is
drawn from this coupler's `outNode` to the partner coupler's `inNode`, so place/orient them
where the pipe should leave and enter.

---

## 6. Pump control — `<sprayerPumpControls>`

The single walk-up node that exposes **all** sprayer prompts (connect, disconnect, valve
open/close, direction). Required for the player to operate the sprayer.

```xml
<sprayerPumpControls>
    <sprayerPumpControl id="1" nodeName="pumpControlNode" radius="1.5"/>
</sprayerPumpControls>
```

| Attribute  | Default | Meaning |
|------------|---------|---------|
| `id`       | index+1 | Identifier. |
| `nodeName` | —       | The control node. **Required** — control skipped if not found. |
| `radius`   | 1.5     | Activation radius in metres. |

Place this node where the operator would stand to work the coupler.

---

## 7. Animations — connector, valve, load

SPS plays three optional animation kinds during the connect/disconnect sequence. All are
optional; without them the system still works, just with no moving parts.

### connectorAnimation / valveAnimation (coupler part animations)

These are **integer ids** on a coupling. They are bound to named *part nodes* found **under
that coupling's mount node** and driven by the SPS coupler animator:

- On **connect**, the connector animation plays forward; the valve starts closed.
- On **valve open/close**, the valve animation plays.
- On **disconnect**, valve then connector animations play in reverse.

The part-node names each id expects are defined by the SPS coupler animator, not by your XML.
For example, in the log the iXtrack's `connectorAnimation="1"` expects part nodes named
`clampHandle01` / `clampHandle02` under the mount node:

```
[SPS] SPSCouplerAnimator.bind: part node 'clampHandle01' not found under mountNode for animation id=1
```

That warning means the animation id is valid but your mount node does not contain the part
nodes that id drives — name your clamp/valve sub-objects to match, or omit the animation
attribute if you do not want it. (If you need the full list of available ids and the exact
part-node names each one expects, that catalogue lives in the SPS coupler animator script —
ask and it can be listed.)

### loadAnimation (vehicle-level)

```xml
<loadAnimation name="toggleCover"/>
```

`name` is one of your vehicle's own declared animations (e.g. a cover/flap). It is shared
across all couplings, played forward as part of connecting and reversed on disconnect. Omit
the element if your sprayer has no such animation. (In the log, `loadAnimationName=nil`
simply means none was declared — that is fine.)

---

## 8. Engine sound — `<sounds>` (optional)

```xml
<sounds>
    <engineLoop ... linkNode="exhaustNode" />
</sounds>
```

`engineLoop` is a standard `loadSampleFromXML` sound, loaded on clients and played while the
valve is open (flowing) and stopped when closed. `linkNode` may reference a node that lives
in your nodeTree rather than your base i3d — SPS injects it into the vehicle's i3dMappings so
the sound can attach to it (see the log line `injected 'exhaustNode' into i3dMappings`).

---

## 9. Operating sequence (what the player does, and what fires)

This is the runtime flow confirmed in the log, so you can sanity-check your setup:

1. Park the sprayer within `maxPipeLength` of the source coupler and walk to the **pump
   control node**.
2. **Connect** — pipe visual is created (`outNode`→`inNode`), connector animations play
   forward, load animation plays, valves initialise **closed**.
   `[SPS SPR] applySprayerConnect: pipe created pipeId=…`
3. **Set direction** (Load = fill the sprayer / Unload = empty it). Only allowed while the
   valve is closed.
   `[SPS SPR] onSprayerToggleDirection: direction=0|1`
4. **Open valve** — this starts the pump and the flow in one action; engine sound starts.
   `[SPS SPR] onSprayerToggleValve: valveOpen=true pumpRunning=true`
   → `[SPS SPR] updateSprayers: flow session STARTED …`
5. **Close valve** to stop. Change direction again if needed.
6. **Disconnect** at the pump control node — pumps stop, valve + connector animations
   reverse, pipe disappears, load animation reverses.

`direction=0` is Load (`SPS_SPRAYER_DIRECTION_FILL`), `direction=1` is Unload
(`SPS_SPRAYER_DIRECTION_DISCHARGE`).

## 10. Minimal worked example

```xml
<vehicle ...>
    ...
    <sprayerPipeSystem>
        <flow litersPerSecond="200"/>

        <sprayerPipeCouplings>
            <sprayerPipeCoupling id="1"
                                 mountNodeName="couplerMount01"
                                 flowDirection="BOTH"
                                 maxPipeLength="7.5"
                                 fillUnitIndex="1"
                                 connectorAnimation="1"/>
        </sprayerPipeCouplings>

        <sprayerPumpControls>
            <sprayerPumpControl id="1" nodeName="pumpControlNode" radius="1.5"/>
        </sprayerPumpControls>

        <!-- optional -->
        <loadAnimation name="toggleCover"/>
        <sounds>
            <engineLoop ... linkNode="exhaustNode"/>
        </sounds>
    </sprayerPipeSystem>
</vehicle>
```

Node requirements for this example:
- `couplerMount01` exists, and contains child transforms named `inNode` and `outNode`.
- `pumpControlNode` exists where the operator stands.
- if `connectorAnimation="1"` is used, the clamp part nodes that id drives exist under
  `couplerMount01` (otherwise drop the attribute).

---

## 11. Checklist

1. Add the `<sprayerPipeSystem>` block to **your own** vehicle XML — never edit the SPS mod.
2. Set `<flow litersPerSecond>`.
3. Add at least one `<sprayerPipeCoupling>` with a `mountNodeName`, and give that mount node
   `inNode` + `outNode` children.
4. Add one `<sprayerPumpControl>` with a `nodeName` — this is the only operator interaction
   point.
5. Optionally add connector/valve/load animations and an engine sound.
6. Load the game and confirm `[SPS SPR] registerSprayerVehicle: registered …`. If a coupler
   or control is missing, the log names exactly which node was not found.

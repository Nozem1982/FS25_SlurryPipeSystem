# Slurry Pipe System (SPS) — Adding Water Sources to a Map

This guide is for **map makers** who want SPS tankers to draw water from a map's lakes,
ponds, rivers or canals using their fill arm (water intake).

**You do this entirely in your own map's i3d** by adding a node tree called
`SPS_waterNodes`. You do not edit the SPS mod. SPS scans the map for this tree on load and
builds the water sources automatically.

---

## 1. How water intake works

A tanker with an **open-pit fill arm** (see the tanker guide), when it is not connected to any
other source, checks whether its arm's centre node is over a water plane:

- **Fill (Load):** the centre node must be **below** the water surface (submerged).
- **Discharge:** the centre node must be **above** the water surface.

If so, SPS creates an **infinite** water source (never depletes) of fill type `WATER`, and the
arm loads/empties water. There is no per-tanker or per-placeable water config — the map
provides the water planes, the tanker uses its normal fill arm.

So your job as a mapper is just to mark where the water is and how high its surface sits.

---

## 2. The node tree — `SPS_waterNodes`

Add this transform group as a child of the map's **terrain root node**, in the map i3d. SPS
finds it with `getChild(terrainRootNode, "SPS_waterNodes")`, so the name must be exactly
`SPS_waterNodes` and it must sit under the terrain root.

```
terrain (terrainRootNode)
└── SPS_waterNodes                      <- exact name, child of terrain root
    ├── lakeNorth                       <- one node per water body (the "plane")
    │   ├── lakeNorth_01                <- a "quad group" (name ends with _<digits>)
    │   │   ├── node1                   <- corner 1
    │   │   ├── node2                   <- corner 2
    │   │   ├── node3                   <- corner 3
    │   │   └── node4                   <- corner 4
    │   ├── lakeNorth_02                <- another quad covering more of the lake
    │   │   ├── node1 ... node4
    │   └── ...
    ├── pondEast
    │   └── pondEast_01 ( node1..node4 )
    └── canal
        └── canal_01 ( node1..node4 )
```

### The rules, exactly as SPS reads them

**Plane node (water body):**
- Each direct child of `SPS_waterNodes` is one water body.
- **Its world Y is the water surface height.** Position the node at the water level. (Only Y
  matters for the surface; X/Z of this node are not used for the footprint.)
- The name is free (used only for logging).

**Quad groups:**
- Under a plane node, each group whose **name ends with an underscore followed by digits**
  (`_01`, `_02`, …) is treated as a quad. They are found by a recursive search, so they may be
  nested if you like, as long as the name pattern matches.
- A water body needs **at least one** quad. Use several quads to cover an irregular shape —
  a point counts as "in water" if it is inside **any** quad of that body.

**Corner nodes:**
- Each quad group must contain **exactly four** children named `node1`, `node2`, `node3`,
  `node4`. Place them at the four corners of that patch of water.
- Their **XZ world positions** define the quad polygon (a horizontal point-in-polygon test).
  Their Y is not used — the surface height comes from the plane node, not the corners.
- Order them around the perimeter (1→2→3→4) so the quad is a sensible non-crossing shape.

If a quad group is missing any of `node1`–`node4` it is skipped with a warning; if a body
ends up with no valid quads it is dropped.

## 3. What you will see in the log

On a correctly set-up map:

```
[SPS WPM] Found SPS_waterNodes in map scenegraph
[SPS WPM] Loaded water plane 'lakeNorth' with 2 quad(s) at Y=12.40
[SPS WPM] Loaded N water plane(s)
```

If the tree is absent:

```
[SPS WPM] No SPS_waterNodes in map scenegraph, checking for external i3d...
[SPS WPM] No water nodes found (map-embedded or external) - water system disabled
```

The `Y=` value is the surface height SPS read from each plane node — check it matches your
actual water level.

---

## 4. Tips

- Keep quads reasonably convex and don't overlap them more than necessary; many small quads
  are fine and let you trace a winding river or an irregular lake edge.
- The surface Y is a single value per water body, so split bodies that sit at different
  heights (e.g. a stepped canal) into separate plane nodes, each at its own level.
- Put the corner nodes a little inside the visible shoreline so a tanker arm has to be
  genuinely over the water, not on the bank.
- Nothing about fill type or capacity needs setting — water is always `WATER` and infinite.

## 5. Note on the external/manifest method (not for map makers)

SPS can also load water nodes from an i3d bundled **inside the SPS mod**
(`water/{mapFolder}/SPS_waterNodes.i3d`, matched to your map by title in
`water/spsWaterManifest.xml`). That path requires editing the SPS mod and is intended only
for shipping pre-made water nodes for maps the author cannot modify. **As a map maker, use the
map-embedded `SPS_waterNodes` tree above** — it lives in your own map, needs no SPS changes,
and will not cause multiplayer issues.

## 6. Checklist

1. In the map i3d, add a transform group named exactly `SPS_waterNodes` under the terrain
   root.
2. Add one child node per water body, positioned at the **water surface height** (its Y).
3. Under each, add one or more quad groups named `…_01`, `…_02`, …
4. Give each quad exactly four corner nodes `node1`–`node4` at the patch corners (XZ).
5. Load the map and confirm `[SPS WPM] Loaded N water plane(s)` with the right `Y=` values.
6. Test with an open-pit fill-arm tanker: lower the arm into the water and it should load
   `WATER`.

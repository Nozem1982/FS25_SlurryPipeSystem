# FS25_SlurryPipeSystem

**Realistic physical slurry pipe system for Farming Simulator 2025.**

Replaces vanilla "drive into a trigger and fill" mechanics with a tactile system where you
physically connect tanker fill arms or pipe chains, run a PTO-driven pump, build pressure,
control flow direction, and watch slurry move through real plumbing — with a slurry that
actually thickens, crusts and blocks if you neglect it.

---

## What it does

**Plumbing & transfer**
- **Fill arms** swung out of the tanker by joystick into open slurry pits or rubber boot
  ports on buildings and other vehicles.
- **Pipe chains** — multi-segment pipes laid by walking from one coupler toward another,
  locked into place when both ends overlap valid couplings.
- **Direct bez pipes** — a single connecting pipe between two nearby couplers, for quick pump
  transfers between a tanker and a building.
- **Conduit pump (PTO Slurry Pump)** — a passive pump trailer that lets two pipe chains
  transfer through it.
- **Animated couplers and valves** — clamp handles close on connect, valve wheels rotate on
  open.
- **Coloured pipes** — pick from a palette per pipe segment, stored per save.
- **Multi-fill-type support** — works with `LIQUIDMANURE` and `DIGESTATE`; transfers
  automatically pick whichever fill type is actually present.

**Pumps & pressure**
- **Pump types** — `vacuum` (stored ±bar pressure model with a gauge), `HVP` high-volume
  pump, `conduit` pump station, and `openTop` passive vessels (e.g. nurse tanks).
- **Pressure model** — vacuum tankers build, hold, taper and purge a stored charge that
  drives fill and discharge; spread behaviour scales with pressure rather than a simple
  on/off.
- **PTO shear bolt (opt-in)** — wears and snaps under load while turning with the PTO
  engaged; walk-up hold-to-repair.

**Slurry that behaves like slurry**
- **Thickness / dry matter** — slurry thickens as dry matter concentrates; thickness affects
  flow and spread.
- **Crust & blockages** — an unmixed store crusts over the season; crusted, lumpy slurry can
  block spreader outlets and the macerator. Mixing clears the risk; **adding water** dilutes
  thick slurry.
- **Agitation** — a manager-driven agitator works on any registered vehicle with an agitator
  tip node, no specialization required.
- **Water intake** — fill arms can draw water straight from map lakes and ponds wherever the
  map provides SPS water planes.

**Spreading**
- **Dribble bars & band spreaders** — per-outlet blockage modelling, distributor macerator,
  and a spreader HUD.
- **Fertiliser / herbicide sprayers** — load liquid fertiliser or herbicide through the same
  coupler-and-pipe system via a dedicated sprayer integration, operated from a single
  walk-up pump control. No pressure model on sprayers — flow is a flat rate.

## How to add support to your own content

**The supported way to add SPS to your own mod is the embedded path below.** You do **not**
edit the SPS mod. Adding files inside the SPS folder is an internal mechanism used only for
the fleet SPS ships itself; doing it to add your own content will cause multiplayer issues.

### Embedded — for modders (recommended, MP-safe, self-contained)

Add a single block to your **own** vehicle, placeable or map. No SPS-side files, no manifest
entry. Players with SPS installed get integration automatically; players without SPS see your
mod work normally. Self-contained, with no conflicts against other mods of the same vehicle.

| Your content | Block to add | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Slurry tankers, dribble bars, nurse tanks, pump trailers | `<slurryPipeSystem>` | inside `<vehicle>` |
| Fertiliser / herbicide sprayers | `<sprayerPipeSystem>` | inside `<vehicle>` |
| Slurry stores, pits, lagoons | `<slurryPipeSystem>` | inside `<placeable>` |
| Liquid-fertiliser source tanks | `<sprayerPipeSystem>` | inside `<placeable>` |
| Map water sources (lakes/ponds) | an `SPS_waterNodes` node tree | in the **map i3d**, under the terrain root |

See the setup guides listed in the documentation map below.

### Bundled / manifest (SPS-internal — not for third-party modders)

How SPS ships support for its own stock fleet: files inside the SPS folder plus a
`spsConfigManifest.xml` entry, matched by config path. This requires modifying the SPS mod
and is **not** a supported way to add your own content — use the embedded path instead.

## Key concepts

### Embedded blocks are detected first

`<slurryPipeSystem>` / `<sprayerPipeSystem>` inside a vehicle or placeable XML are detected
before any manifest lookup. The manifest is only consulted when no embedded block is present.
A third-party retexture of a vehicle can ship its own embedded block and get SPS integration
without affecting other instances of the same base vehicle, and without touching SPS.

### Coupler animations come from the shared library

Coupler clamp and valve animations are defined in the SPS-bundled
`configs/couplerAnimations.xml`. A coupling references an existing animation by integer `id`
(`connectorAnimation` / `valveAnimation`), and SPS resolves that animation's named part nodes
**under the coupling's mount node** and drives them. To use an animation you name your
clamp/valve sub-objects to match the part names that id expects (the file lists them); to add
a genuinely new animation you would extend that library, which is an SPS-side change.

### Path-based manifest matching (internal)

For the bundled fleet, each manifest entry has a `path` that must match the **tail** of the
runtime `configFileName` Giants reports (stock = `data/vehicles/...`, mods =
`mods/<FS25_ModFolderName>/...`). Case-insensitive but otherwise exact — no fuzzy matching.
The bundled `fillPoints.xml` location is auto-derived from the path (drop the filename,
prepend `configs/`, append `fillPoints.xml`), overridable with a `configFolder` attribute.

### Multi-fill-type pipes

Coupling-to-coupling transfers and discharge effects use whatever fill type is present in the
source. A nurse tanker carrying digestate piped to a digestate-accepting store works exactly
like the liquidmanure equivalent.

## Compatibility

- **Manual Attach** — load-order-safe; SPS detects FS25_manualAttach and routes pipe-related
  connection-hose checks through its API when present.
- **Real autosave** — SPS save data is preserved across autosaves.
- **Multiplayer** — server-authoritative state; valve toggles, connections, pressure, pump
  and shear-bolt state all sync via dedicated events.
